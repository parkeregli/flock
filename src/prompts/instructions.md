# Autonomous AI Developer Workflow Guide

## Initial Processing
- Parse the provided markdown specification document
- Generate structured task list from requirements
- Create internal validation checklist based on specification
- Store original specification for final verification
- Create a new branch for implementation

## Branch Creation
```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/auto-implementation-{timestamp}
```

## Implementation Phase
- Process requirements sequentially without waiting for feedback
- Generate all necessary code files
- Create corresponding test files
- Implement error handling and logging
- Add required documentation

## Testing Phase
- Execute full test suite autonomously
- Record all test results and coverage metrics
- Store test execution logs
- Document any edge cases encountered

## Success Metrics
- All requirements implemented
- Test coverage meets minimum threshold
- No linting errors present

This async workflow operates independently without requiring human intervention until review phase. All decisions and implementations are made based on the initial specification document.

Here is the full specification document:
